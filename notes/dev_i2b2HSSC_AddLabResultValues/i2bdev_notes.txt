Issues that came up:

A. (added /todo item in slack) From #0 below, about 15% of results have UOM values that do not match the most common UOM for the LOINC.

B. (added /todo item in slack) There are cases where more than one source concept is mapped to a single loinc_cd (e.g., in visit_id 130087634001, prothrombin ratio PTR *and* partial thromboplastin time PTT are both mapped to LOINC 5902-2).  This is one source of the 5,625 Primary Key errors (<0.3% of records processed) but also leads can lead to misinterpretation of result searches.

Dev Steps:

0. check labs UOM normalization (about 15% of results have units that do not match the most common UOM for the LOINC):
```

select
  decode(rnk_uom_within_loinc,
           1,'N_NORMED',
           'N_NOT_NORMED'
        ) n_by_normed_status,
  count(1) n_loinc_codes,
  sum(n_results_loinc_uom) n_results
from
  (
      select
        loinc_cd,
        result_uom,
        n_results_loinc,
        n_results_loinc_uom,
        round(n_results_loinc_uom/n_results_loinc,2) f_results_loinc_uom,
        rank() over (partition by loinc_cd order by n_results_loinc_uom desc) as rnk_uom_within_loinc
      from
        (
          select
            loinc_cd,
            UPPER(nvl(result_uom, 1)) result_uom,
            sum(count(1)) over (partition by loinc_cd) n_results_loinc,
            count(1) n_results_loinc_uom
          from cdw.lab_result
          where loinc_cd is not null
          group by
            loinc_cd,
            UPPER(nvl(result_uom, 1))
        )
      order by --rnk_uom_within_loinc, n_results_loinc desc
            loinc_cd,
            n_results_loinc desc,
            n_results_loinc_uom desc
  )
group by decode(rnk_uom_within_loinc,1,'N_NORMED', 'N_NOT_NORMED')
order by n_by_normed_status
;
--N_NORMED	279	1976119
--N_NOT_NORMED	150	359190
```

1. checked counts already in dev (i2bdev_labs_countSumm_b4.dsv)
```
select
  concept_cd,
  tval_char,
  valtype_cd,
  count(1),
  count(encounter_num),
  count(distinct encounter_num),
  count(patient_num),
  count(distinct patient_num),
  count(start_date),
  count(distinct start_date),
  count(nval_num),
  count(distinct nval_num),
  count(units_cd),
  count(distinct units_cd),
  min(nval_num),
  avg(nval_num),
  max(nval_num)
from i2b2HSSCdata.observation_fact
where concept_cd like 'LOINC%'
group by
  concept_cd,
  tval_char,
  valtype_cd
order by count(1) desc
;
```
2. delete labs in i2bdev (240 seconds; 2,317,623 rows deleted)
```
delete from i2b2HSSCdata.observation_fact
where concept_cd like 'LOINC%'
;
```

3. modified ETL_LABS, compiled in HSSC_ETL@i2bdev
    a. 'N' in valtype_cd ('N' for Numeric; 'T' for Text)
    b. result value in nval_num (since Numeric)
    c. uom in units_cd
    d. 'E' in tval_char (with Numeric, 'E' = 'Equals')

4. ran ETL_LABS in HSSC_ETL into i2bdev (583 seconds, 2317623 inserted, 5625 PK errors):
```
begin
  HSSC_ETL.ETL_LABS();
end;
/
```

5. re-ran i2bdev_labs_countSumm (see i2bdev_labs_countSumm.dsv)

6. compare counts from last time:
```
diff \
  <(awk -F'|' '{print $1,$4}' i2bdev_labs_countSumm_b4.dsv) \
  <(awk -F'|' '{print $1,$4}' i2bdev_labs_countSumm_aftr.dsv)
```

7. manually check that values and units are populated (note that having more than one distinct UNITS_CD is a symptom of the 15% of results that have deviant UOM codes):

```
awk -F'|' '{print $1,$(NF-2),$(NF),$(NF-1),$(NF-3),$(NF-4)}' i2bdev_labs_countSumm_aftr.dsv | less -N
```
