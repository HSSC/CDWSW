1. procedures in cdm.  AFTER verifying that the records are truly duplicates...

delete from pcori2.pmn_procedures
where rowid in (
select rec from
(
select /*+ parallel 4 */
  rowid rec,
  proceduresid,
  rank() over (partition by proceduresid order by rowid) seq
from pcori2.pmn_procedures
)
where seq > 1
)
;
--18 records deleted, as expected

2. Why is raw_px_type=C2 for px_type=C4?

select /*+ parallel */
  raw_px_type,
  px_type,
  count(1)
from pcori2.pmn_procedures
group by 
  raw_px_type,
  px_type
order by
  raw_px_type,
  px_type
;

3. remove duplicate diagnosis and vital records:

--- created sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE PCORI2.DIAGNOSISID_SEQ
        INCREMENT BY 1
        START WITH 1001
        MAXVALUE 9999999999999999999999999999
        NOMINVALUE
        NOCYCLE
        CACHE 20
        NOORDER
GO
 
CREATE SEQUENCE PCORI2.VITALID_SEQ
        INCREMENT BY 1
        START WITH 1001
        MAXVALUE 9999999999999999999999999999
        NOMINVALUE
        NOCYCLE
        CACHE 20
        NOORDER
GO
 
--- altered the tables
ALTER TABLE PCORI2.PMN_DIAGNOSIS ADD (DIAGNOSISID_OLD VARCHAR2(50))
 
ALTER TABLE PCORI2.PMN_VITAL ADD (VITALID_OLD VARCHAR2(50))
 
---- populated the ‘old’ columns
UPDATE PCORI2.PMN_DIAGNOSIS SET DIAGNOSISID_OLD = DIAGNOSISID
COMMIT
 
UPDATE PCORI2.PMN_VITAL SET VITALID_OLD = VITALID
COMMIT
 
---- repopulated the ID columns
 
UPDATE PCORI2.PMN_DIAGNOSIS SET DIAGNOSISID = PCORI2.DIAGNOSISID_SEQ.NEXTVAL
COMMIT
 
UPDATE PCORI2.PMN_VITAL SET VITALID = PCORI2.VITALID_SEQ.NEXTVAL
COMMIT
